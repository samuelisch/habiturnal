# Reflect

Full stack application using React-Typescript with Django-REST-framework and PostgreSQL.

## Access and Deployment

To be updated

### Motivation
This project is a experiment into using Django as a backend framework. I specifically used the django-rest-frameowrk, and manipulated my database with it. Another motivation for this project was to be more comfortable in using TypeScript, and the proper implementation of typing in React.

### Features / Technologies used
#### Frontend:
- React w Redux Toolkit
- TypeScript
- SASS (modules.scss)
- React-Router v6
- axios

#### Backend:
- Django w django-rest-framework
- Django simpleJWT
- PostgreSQL

### Blockers and Future implementations
#### Blockers
- Time - There were far too many features to be implemented within the time I set for myself
- Django - a particular pain point as I am unfamiliar with Python and the overall Django framework, I am also currently still exploring the fundamentals of relational databases.

#### Future implementations
- I plan to add form validations for the project - it would be quite unsafe to deploy otherwise.
- Styling for bigger screens / desktops
- Addition of a search bar to filter journals on the right side of the application, to be shown only when the window is expanded
- Settings - user settings components, that enables users to change their usernames and passwords
